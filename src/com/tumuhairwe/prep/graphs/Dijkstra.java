/**
 * Definition:
 * - Dijkstra's algorithm is a Single Source Shortest Path (SSSP) search that uses a greedy approach to calculate the shortest path
 * from a given source to all other vertices.
 * - Dijkstra's algorithm doesn't calculate all paths, but stops when it finds the shortest path.
 * - Uses  PQ (queue implementation) that pulls the node with the lowest cost
 * - Find the distance from source-node to all other nodes (where as BFS finds count-of-steps between source and destination
 *
 * Main points
 * - used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a weighted graph
 * - It uses a priority queue to track the nodes that have been visited and the nodes that still need to be visited.
 * - The algorithm terminates when the destination node is reached.
 * - The algorithm works by starting at the source node and then greedily adding the node with the shortest path to the priority queue.
 *
 * Solution summary
 * - Definition: An algorithm to find the shortest path
 * - Steps
 *  - Create adjacency-list of all nodes (Map: key=nodeId, value=[ {neighborNodeId}, {weight} ]
 *  - Create minHeap/PQ ordered by weight
 *  - Seed minHeap with sourceId + 0 distance
 *  - Populate minHeap (while iterating & getting destinations from adjList.get(sourceNodeId) until all destinations are exhausted
 *  - Return adjList Map { key=nodeId, value = weight-to-destination }
 *
 *  TC: O(V + E(log V)) bcoz PQ has O(log_n) tc for push() and pop() operations

    /**
     * As you can see, the first two steps are to initialize the distances with a large value and to add the source node to the queue.
     * Next, we perform iterations until the queue becomes empty. In each iteration, we extract a node from the queue that
     * has the shortest distance from the source node.
     *
     * After that, we visit all the neighbors of the extracted node and check the new distance we were able to achieve.
     * If the new distance is better than the old one, we update the distance of this node and push it to the queue.
     * Finally, the algorithm moves to perform one more iteration until the queue becomes empty.
     *
     * After the algorithm ends, weâ€™ll have the shortest paths from the source node to all other nodes in the graph.
